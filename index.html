    <h3>What is CSS</h3>
    <ol class="list1">
      <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheets</li>
      <li>
        css describe how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,aper or in
        the other media
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="a"> Css is not necessary.</span>
        <span class="c">css saves lot of work</span> and can control the kayout
        of multiple web pages all at once
      </li>
      <li id="a">extrenl style sheets are sorted in css files</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML Document in 3 ways</h3>
    <ul class="list2" type="disc">
      <li>Inline-using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
      <li>Internal- using style element in head section of the HTML file</li>
      <li>external- using style element to link to a external CSS file</li>

      <li>
        The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS
        files. However,<span class="c">
          in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span
        >, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it
        yourself.
      </li>
      <br />
    </ul>
    <p>
      When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a
      style to multiple elements. ID. on the other hand, applies a style to one
      unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to
      link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
      elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set
      of styles can be applied to the element. There is a wide range of
      selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both
      are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
